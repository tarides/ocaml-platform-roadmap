# OCaml Platform Roadmap

**This repository contains the roadmap for the OCaml Platform, which lays down
the direction of the OCaml Platform for the next three years. The primary focus
is to build a seamless IDE experience and a thriving community of open-source
projects that constitute the Platform.**

> **Note**: The roadmap is a work-in-progress. We're developping it in the open
> and any input is welcome, so don't hesitate to open an issue to share your
> feedback. Since Tarides is taking the initiative to establishing a roadmap for
> the OCaml Platform in collaboration with the Platform maintainers and the
> community, we're hosting the work-in-progress roadmap on the Tarides GitHub
> organisation. However, the OCaml Platform is a community project, so once
> we'll have iterated on the community's feedback and will be ready to adopt a
> first version of the roadmap, we will host it on OCaml.org.

The OCaml Platform is the recommended toolchain to work and be productive with
OCaml. It is designed as a collection of tools that improve the overall
developer experience by addressing various user experience (UX) gaps in OCaml
development, such as build automation, package management, documentation
generation, code formatting, and more.

The OCaml Platform is built on the principle that a language is only as good as
the tools and ecosystem surrounding it. Over the past 25 years, the OCaml
Platform has evolved to include many different tools, each of which serves a
specific purpose and often does its job well. However, the overall developer
experience can be suboptimal because some of these tools overlap in
functionality and have different user interfaces and workflows. The roadmap we
present here aims at addressing these issues by both creating an integrated
unified experience and improving specific workflows.
